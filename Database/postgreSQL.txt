-- CREATE TABLE

CREATE TABLE customers(

	customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
  	first_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
  	last_name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
    age INTEGER 

) 

-- CRUD CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE 

-- INSERT CUSTOMER TO THE TABLE 
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, last_name, age) VALUES('John','Doe', 45) 
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, last_name, age) VALUES('Steven','Smith', 55)
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, last_name, age) VALUES('Mary', 'Doe', 75)

INSERT INTO customers(first_name) VALUES('Jerry')

-- GET ALL CUSTOMERS

SELECT * FROM customers -- Data is returne as a SET, not reccomened

SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, age FROM customers -- better since this will crate a build plan


--DELETING A CUSTOMER
DELETE FROM customers -- dangerous because it will delete everything from the customers table

-- Always a good idea to use PK(primary key) when deleting a record
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1

--UPDATE 
UPDATE customers
SET last_name = 'Doe', age = 66
WHERE customer_id = 2

UPDATE customers
SET age = 34
WHERE customer_id = 4


--SELECT AND WHERE
SELECT customer_id, first_name,last_name,age FROM customers
WHRE age >= 66

-- ORDER BY
SELECT customer_id, first_name,last_name, age FROM customers
ORDER BY customer_id DESC

SELECT customer_id, first_name,last_name, age FROM customers
ORDER BY customer_id ASC

--Delteting a table = DROP TABLE customers

ALTER TABLE customers
DROP COLUMN fist_name

DROP TABLE customers
